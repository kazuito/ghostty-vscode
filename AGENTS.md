# Ghostty VSCode Extension

A VS Code extension providing language support for Ghostty terminal
configuration files: formatting, quick fixes, and outline support.
Activates for `**/ghostty/config`, `**/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`, and
files ending in `.ghostty`.

## Current Project State

- Ships syntax highlighting plus six language-server features: hover,
  completion, diagnostics, formatting, code actions, document symbols.
- The language server is organized as vertical feature slices.
  `src/server.ts` only wires providers together; each feature owns its
  LSP adapter and logic under `src/features/<feature>/`. Shared
  config-domain primitives live in `src/core/`, Ghostty CLI integration in
  `src/ghostty/`, generated config keys in `src/generated/`.
- Builds are bundled with Rolldown into `out/extension.js` and
  `out/server.js`; there is no standalone `pnpm compile` script.
- The server shells out to the Ghostty CLI (`ghostty.executablePath`) at
  startup and during validation to load defaults, installed fonts, and CLI
  diagnostics.
- Config **key list and descriptions** are generated from Ghostty's
  upstream docs into `src/generated/config-keys.ts` by
  `scripts/gen-config.ts` (run `pnpm gen:config`). Committed; the build
  never touches the network.
- `src/core/schema.ts` merges the generated list with a hand-curated
  overlay (`configMetadata`) for metadata the docs don't expose
  machine-readably: per-key value enums, color/font asset hints,
  comma-separated semantics, the `additiveKeys` set, and description
  overrides.
- Keep `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `package.json` aligned with the
  actual shipped feature set.

## Architecture

Each feature folder pairs `provider.ts` (LSP adapter) with its logic.
Single-file features keep one logic file named after the feature;
multi-file features (diagnostics, formatter) keep split modules plus an
`index.ts` barrel.

```text

├── extension.ts    # VSCode entry point; starts the language server
├── server.ts       # LSP bootstrap; registers feature providers
├── features/       # hover, completion, codeActions, documentSymbols,
│                   # diagnostics, formatter — each provider.ts + logic
├── core/           # document.ts, schema.ts, types.ts, constants.ts
├── ghostty/        # CLI integration: defaults, fonts, colors, actions, reload
└── generated/
    └── config-keys.ts   # Generated config keys + descriptions (do not edit)

src/test/           # Vitest suite (centralized), one file per feature/module
```

Dependency direction is one-way: `generated → core → features → ghostty`,
with `server.ts` wiring the feature providers together. Generated output is
written to `out/`; never hand-edit files there.

### Feature notes

- **Hover** — looks up the key from the hovered line in
  `ghosttyConfigOptions`; returns description, default value, and a link to
  `https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#<key>`.
- **Completion** — before `=`, suggests keys (deduped unless in
  `additiveKeys`); after `=`, suggests each key's `enum` values plus named
  colors/installed fonts for `assets`-tagged keys; for comma-separated
  values, only replaces the segment after the last comma.
- **Diagnostics** — in-process validation only flags duplicate
  non-additive keys; unknown keys and invalid values come from
  `ghostty +validate-config`, run async. That CLI emits two output formats
  (`file:line:field: msg` vs. unlocated `field: msg` once a theme/secondary
  config loads); `parseGhosttyOutput` handles both. A fallback diagnostic
  surfaces raw output if nothing could be parsed, so CLI format drift can't
  fail silently.
- **Formatter** — pure helpers (`parseLine`, `formatValue`,
  `formatDocument`) with no LSP dependency; normalizes `=` spacing,
  blank-line runs, hex color casing/`#` prefix, boolean casing, comma
  spacing, leading/trailing whitespace. Leaves quoted strings and named
  colors untouched. Reads `ghostty.format.*` settings.
- **Code Actions** — quick fixes derived from diagnostics: unknown keys get
  `Remove line` plus up to three Levenshtein-based `Did you mean ...?`
  suggestions; duplicate non-additive keys get `Remove line`; invalid
  enum/literal/boolean values get up to five `Replace with ...` suggestions.
- **Document Symbols** — one `Property` symbol per non-comment, non-blank
  line, keyed on the config key; powers Outline/breadcrumbs.
- **Shared Schema** (`src/core/schema.ts`) — builds
  `ghosttyConfigOptions: ConfigEntry[]` by merging generated keys with the
  `configMetadata` overlay; exports `additiveKeys`, `optionByKey`,
  `validKeys`, `commaKeys`.

## Syntax Highlighting

`package.json` contributes language ID `ghostty-config`, the grammar
`syntaxes/ghostty-config.tmLanguage.json`, `language-configuration.json`
(line comments, bracket pairs, auto-closing), and `ghostty.format.*`
settings.

The key alternation and enum-value alternation in the grammar are
**generated** by `scripts/gen-config.ts` — run `pnpm gen:config` after key
or enum changes rather than hand-editing those regexes. Other token
patterns (strings, numbers, colors, paths) are hand-maintained. A Vitest
drift check (`src/test/generated.test.ts`) asserts the grammar key set
matches the generated key set.

## Build And Verification

```bash
pnpm gen:config # Regenerate config keys/descriptions + grammar from upstream MDX
pnpm bundle     # Rolldown bundle to out/
pnpm watch      # Rolldown watch build
pnpm typecheck  # Type-check without emitting
pnpm lint       # Biome lint
pnpm format     # Biome format --write
pnpm check      # Biome check --write --unsafe + typecheck
pnpm test       # Vitest suite under src/test/
```

`prepare` runs `husky`; `rolldown.config.ts` controls the client/server
bundles emitted into `out/`. `examples/` holds sample configs for manual
verification in VSCode.

## Working Rules For Future Changes

- To pick up upstream key/description changes, run `pnpm gen:config` and
  commit the regenerated `src/generated/config-keys.ts` and grammar. Don't
  hand-edit the generated file or the grammar's key/enum alternations.
- For value/validation metadata (enums, color/font assets, comma
  semantics), edit `configMetadata` in `src/core/schema.ts`;
  `pnpm gen:config` reads it to regenerate the grammar's enum alternation.
- If a key is valid multiple times in one file, add it to `additiveKeys`.
- If schema changes affect completion, diagnostics, formatter, or code
  actions, update the relevant Vitest coverage in `src/test/`.
- New LSP features get their own `src/features/<feature>/` (provider.ts +
  logic), registered in `src/server.ts`. Shared logic goes in `src/core/`.
- If you add or rename formatter settings, update `package.json` and
  `README.md`.
- When cutting a release: bump `package.json`, add a dated `CHANGELOG.md`
  entry, keep `README.md` aligned with user-visible behavior.
- Rebundle `out/` before testing in VS Code or publishing.
